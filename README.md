# 🗡️ WhisperScribe: The Ultimate Self-Hosted Transcription Service
“Strange AI lying in ponds transcribing audio is no basis for a system of governance!”

## 📜 What is WhisperScribe?

Do you find yourself buried under a mountain of audio recordings, grasping desperately for meaning like a confused peasant at a royal decree? Do you seek local, private, automated transcription that doesn’t require you to hand over your data to the shadowy overlords of the cloud?

BEHOLD! WhisperScribe! The self-hosted, fully automated transcription service that lets you transcribe your audio privately, efficiently, and without mysterious third parties flinging proprietary APIs at you from murky waters!

## 🛡️ Why WhisperScribe?

✅ Private – Runs entirely on your machine. No invasive servers. No questionable data handling. Just you and your files.
✅ Local-Only – After installation, no internet is required to transcribe your files. You reign supreme over your kingdom of data! 🏰
✅ Automated – Drop audio files into the sacred Whisper folder, and behold! A transcript appears! ✨
✅ Self-Contained – Installs everything it needs: Whisper AI, Ollama LLM, fswatch, and absolutely no mystical entities distributing software licenses!

## 📥 Installation: Summon It With a Single Command!

To conjure WhisperScribe into existence, simply recite this powerful incantation into your terminal:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oldsoul-io/WhisperScribe/v0.1.0-alpha/setup.sh | bash
```
This will:
🛠 Set up directories (No more hunting for shrubberies 🌿)
📦 Install necessary packages (Python, Whisper, Ollama, and ancient runes of automation)
👀 Begin monitoring your Whisper folder (Like an overzealous medieval scribe)
📜 Transcribe audio files automatically (No need to enslave a bard)

Once installed, simply drop an audio file into ~/WhisperScribe/, and within moments, a miraculously transcribed .txt file shall appear—delivered with unwavering efficiency (and absolutely no ridiculous questions about migratory birds).

### 📁 Directory Structure
Once installed, WhisperScribe will reside in ~/WhisperScribe/ with the following organization:
```
WhisperScribe/
│── scripts/          # The mystical scripts that make it all work
│── logs/             # Transcription logs (so you can trace your misdeeds)
│── transcripts/      # Where the completed transcripts reside
│── archive/          # A vault for processed audio files
│── whisper-env/      # The sacred Python environment
│── setup.sh          # The ancient installer scroll
```
This ensures that all your data remains under your control (unless, of course, a ferocious killer rabbit decides to claim dominion over your device 🐰🔪).

## 🏰 Why Accept WhisperScribe as Sovereign of the Script?

Some argue that transcription should be entrusted to corporate cloud entities who extract a tithe of your data in exchange for their services. But we say unto them:
Nay! For I AM YOUR TRANSCRIBER!

- 🕵️ Transparent – The scripts are laid bare for all to see, free from obfuscation, sinister rituals, or inexplicable trebuchets.
- 🔍 Auditable – Anyone may inspect the sacred code before running it, for it is not dispensed by some unknown figure lobbing software from a distant server farm!
- 🤝 Privacy-Respecting – The system does not call out to the cloud, nor does it engage in capitalist oppression telemetry.

Thus, WhisperScribe is yours and yours alone—no cloud, no tracking, no inexplicable pacts with unseen forces—just pure, unadulterated transcription wizardry, wielded solely by the one who installs it. (That would be you, noble user.) 🏰✍️

## 🧐 Summoning Assistance in Times of Woe
Shouldst thou find thyself in distress, thou may seek aid by:
- Consulting the Holy Wiki Scrolls 📜
- Submitting an issue, lest ye be forcibly spanked by Zoot 💃🔥
- Yelling into the void 💨 (though success rates vary based on lunar cycles and coconut availability)

## 🛠 Troubleshooting: When Things Go Pear-Shaped
“What do you mean, things aren’t working? I specifically designed this to be completely foolproof! …Ah. Right. Well, let’s fix it then.”

- Issue: Transcripts aren’t appearing!
Solution: Have you actually placed an audio file into the folder? If not, please do so. If yes, have you spoken words into it, or were you just breathing heavily into the microphone like a lurking assassin?

- Issue: Setup failed!
Solution: Have you tried turning your computer off and on again, or must I summon the Spanish Inquisition?

- Issue: My computer burst into flames!
Solution: Ah. You may have invoked an ancient and forbidden Whisper model. Quickly, douse your machine with holy water and recite the README backward.
