## 📥 Installation: Summon It With a Single Command!

To conjure WhisperScribe into existence, simply recite this powerful incantation into your terminal:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oldsoul-io/WhisperScribe/v0.1.0-beta/setup.sh | bash
```

**This will:** </br>
> ### 🛠 **Set up directories** </br>
> (_No more hunting for shrubberies_ 🌿)
>
> ### 📦 **Install necessary packages** </br>
> (_Python, Whisper, Ollama, and ancient runes of automation_)
> 
> ### 👀 **Begin monitoring your Whisper folder** </br>
> (_Like an overzealous medieval scribe_)
> 
> ### 📜 **Transcribe audio files automatically** </br>
> (_No need to enslave a bard_)
 
Once installed, simply drop an audio file into `~/WhisperScribe/`, and within moments, a miraculously transcribed `.txt` file shall appear——delivered with unwavering efficiency (_and absolutely no ridiculous questions about the airspeed velocity of migratory birds_).


### 📁 Directory Structure
Once installed, WhisperScribe will reside in ~/WhisperScribe/ with the following organization:
```
WhisperScribe/
│── scripts/          # The mystical scripts that make it all work
│── logs/             # Transcription logs (so you can trace your misdeeds)
│── transcripts/      # Where the completed transcripts reside
│── archive/          # A vault for processed audio files
│── whisper-env/      # The sacred Python environment
│── setup.sh          # The ancient installer scroll
```
This ensures that all your data remains under your control (unless, of course, a ferocious killer rabbit decides to claim dominion over your device 🐰🔪).

## 🏰 Why Accept WhisperScribe as Sovereign of the Script?

Some argue that transcription should be entrusted to corporate cloud entities who extract a tithe of your data in exchange for their services. But we say unto them:
Nay! For I AM YOUR TRANSCRIBER!

> ### 🕵️ Transparent
> _The scripts are laid bare for all to see, free from obfuscation, </br>sinister rituals, or inexplicable trebuchets._
> ### 🔍 Auditable
> _Anyone may inspect the sacred code before running it, for it is not dispensed </br>by some unknown figure lobbing software from a distant server farm!_
> ### 🤝 Privacy-Respecting
> _The system does not call out to the cloud, </br>nor does it engage in capitalist oppression telemetry._

Thus, WhisperScribe is yours and yours alone—no cloud, no tracking, no inexplicable pacts with unseen forces—just pure, unadulterated transcription wizardry, wielded solely by the one who installs it. (That would be you, noble user.) 🏰✍️
